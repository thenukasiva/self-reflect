ðŸ““Self-Reflect is a chrome extension that reminds users to reflect on their day and saves their entries on a React app hosted locally on their computer. 

## Technologies used: 
- Web application: React.js, Bootstrap, Reactstrap, a bit of Node.js and Web Storage API
- Chrome Extension: HTML, CSS, Javascript

I created this application to explore the basics of React and made it a chrome extension so that I can use it in my day-to-day life. 
Users can either click the button on the popup which will direct user to the React app where they can store their entries. Previous entries are stored via local storage. 

1. The popup (chrome extension) is available to the user when they download the files under "self-reflect-chrome-extension" and set the chrome extension up locally (manage extensions -> load unpacked -> open self-reflect-chrome-extension folder". 
2. Follow React instructions to set it up locally.

## React Instructions

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!**

If you arenâ€™t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point youâ€™re on your own.

You donâ€™t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldnâ€™t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldnâ€™t be useful if you couldnâ€™t customize it when you are ready for it.
